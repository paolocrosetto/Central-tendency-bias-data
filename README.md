# Data and scripts for the "Central Tendency Bias in Belief Elicitation" by Paolo Crosetto, Antonio Filippin, Peter Katuščák and John Smith

This repository contains original data and all scripts to recreate figures and tables from the paper *Central Tendency Bias in Belief Elicitation*, forthcoming in the Journal of Economic Psychology. 

## The paper

In the paper we document that players instructed about a uniform distribution and having passed control questions about it still hold central-single peaked *subjective* beliefs. This result is robust and cannot be imputed to mistakes and misunderstandings, the chosen elicitation mechanism, risk aversion, hedging,nor inconsistency. We provide indicative evidence that such subject beliefs can be rationalized by well-defined subjective beliefs that differ from the objective truth.
